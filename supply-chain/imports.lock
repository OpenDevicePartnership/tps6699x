This audit has been reviewed in https://crrev.com/c/5811890

The crate is fairly easy to read thanks to its small size and rich comments.

I've grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `\bfs\b`, `\bnet\b`, and
`\bunsafe\b`.  There were no hits (except for a comment in `README.md`
and `lib.rs` pointing out "Zero `unsafe`").

Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at

The crate exposes a function marked as `unsafe`, but doesn't use any
`unsafe` blocks (except for tests of the single `unsafe` function).  I
think this justifies marking this crate as `ub-risk-1`.

Inheriting ub-risk-1 from the baseline review of 1.13.0. While the delta has some diffs in unsafe code, they are either:
- migrating code to use helper macros
- migrating match patterns to take advantage of default bindings mode from RFC 2005
Either way, the result is code that does exactly the same thing and does not change the risk of UB.
